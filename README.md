SDX Mods for the game 7 Days to Die Alpha 16.4 ONLY

Using SDX 0.7.2 - http://7d.l9000.co.uk/SDTD/SDTD.asmx/GetLatestSdxDownload


**EnableEditMode** - Enables the built-in edit mode to allow creation, saving, loading, of prefabs and more.

**MinibikeOpenUI** - Allows inventory/map/etc to be opened while mounted on a minibike.  Client side only required.

**MinibikeImpact** - Allows minibike to once again collide with entities such as zombies and animals.  Client side only required since the calculations are done in the client, but this mod could also work on the dedicated server assembly.

**NoExceptionHijack** - Stops the command console from taking focus of your game whenever an exception is thrown.  Client side only required.

**ItemEatDelayRemover** - Removes an animation delay check that can cause certain items, when consumed from the inventory, to fail to take effect.  Client side only required.

**ItemActionLauncherFix** - Fixes a graphical glitch that leaves a crossbow bolt in the right hand when using modded crossbows.  Client side only required.

**ConsoleCommands** - Adds the Mods.dll to the list of assemblies to be scanned for adding new commands to the game.  Thanks to StompyNZ for the help with this mod.


**TormentedEmuAIO** - All of my SDX mods bundled in one package for the Client version.  Simplifies SDX modding if you want to include all of the mods.  For best results, do not use this package with any of my other mods listed above.
